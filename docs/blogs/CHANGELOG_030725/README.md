2. **User Experience Refinement** - Creating smoother interactions between users and agents
3. **Admin Tooling Enhancement** - Giving organizations powerful visibility into conversations and usage patterns

Suite is an AI-powered engine designed to streamline DeFi adoption by integrating cutting-edge AI agents into blockchain applications. Built on Base, Suite helps users navigate on-chain actions, understand DeFi opportunities, and make informed decisionsâ€”without needing deep technical knowledge of blockchain.

Below is an overview of recent improvements, new features, and what's coming next.
